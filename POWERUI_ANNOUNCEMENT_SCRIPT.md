# POWER UI: THE FUTURE OF POWER BI THEMING

## Opening
*[Executive walks on stage]*

Good morning.

For years, Power UI has had a simple mission: bring professional design principles to Power BI. What began as a tool for creating basic themes has evolved into something much more significant.

*[SLIDE: Power UI Impact]*

Today, thousands of organizations rely on Power UI. Fortune 500 companies use it to maintain consistent design systems across hundreds of reports. Data teams use it to ensure their insights are not just accurate, but accessible. Individual analysts use it to create reports that drive real business decisions.

*[SLIDE: Community Growth]*

The work this community has produced speaks for itself. Complex financial dashboards that feel intuitive. Healthcare analytics that clinicians can actually use. Supply chain reports that transform data into understanding.

But there's always been a gap between designing a theme and knowing how it will actually look in production.

*[SLIDE: Theme Studio Preview]*

Today, that changes.

I'd like to introduce the new Power UI Theme Studio.

---

## Introducing Theme Studio
*[SLIDE: Theme Studio Interface]*

This is Theme Studio. A completely new way to design Power BI themes.

---

## The Foundation You Know
*[DEMO: Quick Customization]*

Let me start with something familiar.

The Quick Customization that's been core to Power UI remains at the center of Theme Studio. But now it's more powerful.

*[DEMO: Quick Styles Tab]*

Quick Styles now offers granular control over padding, borders, and backgrounds. Each option doesn't just change a single property—it updates your entire theme systematically. Small padding adjusts 47 different spacing values. Rounded corners maintains proportions across all visual types. Subtle backgrounds ensure proper contrast ratios throughout.

*[DEMO: Light/Dark Mode Toggle]*

And with our refined token system, switching between light and dark modes is seamless. Every color, every contrast, every relationship—preserved perfectly.

---

## Real-Time Preview
*[SLIDE: Power BI Embedded]*

But the real breakthrough is here.

*[DEMO: Live Power BI Preview]*

Through Power BI Embedded, Theme Studio shows you exactly how your theme will look—as you design it. This is a live Power BI report, with real visuals, responding to every change you make.

*[Change a color]*

The feedback is immediate. No export process. No context switching. Just direct, visual feedback.

*[DEMO: Visual Focus Mode]*

Select any visual to enter focus mode. See precisely how your theme handles expanded views. Test against different report types. Validate your design decisions in real time.

---

## Design Tokens
*[SLIDE: Design Tokens]*

Underlying everything is a token-based design system.

*[DEMO: Token System]*

Tokens are semantic color assignments. Rather than setting hundreds of individual properties, you define relationships. Primary text. Secondary backgrounds. Border colors. The system understands context and applies your design decisions intelligently.

*[DEMO: Unified Color Picker]*

The Unified Color Picker brings this all together. Access tokens, theme colors, and custom values from a single interface. See relationships. Understand impact. Make informed decisions.

---

## Technical Precision
*[DEMO: JSON Preview]*

For those who need to see under the hood, Theme Studio includes real-time JSON preview. Watch the theme structure build as you work. Validate syntax. Understand the output. The generation algorithm ensures valid JSON that Power BI will accept every time.

---

## Comprehensive Control
*[SLIDE: Visual Styles Panel]*

The Visual Styles panel provides access to every themeable property in Power BI.

*[DEMO: Typography & Fonts]*

Typography control starts at the global level and cascades down. Set a base font family. Override for specific elements where needed. Maintain consistency while allowing flexibility.

*[DEMO: Change Tracking]*

Every modification is tracked. Visual indicators show what's changed. The header displays your unsaved change count. You always know exactly where you are in the design process.

---

## Style Presets - Industry First
*[DEMO: Style Presets]*

Now here's something really special. 

Microsoft announced Style Presets just a few months ago—a game-changer for creating consistent design systems in Power BI. Today, Power UI becomes the first and only software that lets you customize these presets.

*[DEMO: Creating Presets]*

Watch how easy this is. Focus on any visual. Create a new variant. Customize it. See it update in real-time. Need a different size for a header? Simply adjust the dimensions. *[Demonstrate resizing]* Perfect.

Thanks to my new JSON merge algorithm, every preset inherits intelligently from your base styles while maintaining its unique properties. It's powerful. It's flexible. And it just works.

---

## Import and Transform
*[DEMO: Import Feature]*

**Import and Transform**

Have themes from other tools? No problem. Import them directly into Theme Studio and make them your own. Every property, every color, every detail—now fully customizable.

*[DEMO: Color Palette]*

Creating custom palettes has never been easier. Add colors manually, or paste a URL directly from Coolors. Watch as your palette instantly transforms your entire report. Beautiful.

*[DEMO: Brand Palette Generator]*

But here's something truly magical. Have a brand color? Just one? Watch this. *[Enter brand color]* My AI-powered Brand Palette Generator creates an entire harmonious palette from that single color. Instantly. Professionally balanced. Ready to use.

*[DEMO: State Palettes]*

And for your KPIs and status indicators, I've built in State Palettes—pre-configured success, warning, and error colors that are accessibility-tested and work perfectly with your theme.

---

## Your Design Hub
*[SLIDE: Theme Dashboard]*

**Your Design Hub**

The new Theme Dashboard is your central hub for everything theme-related. View all your themes, download Power BI template files, access resources—it's all here, beautifully organized.

---

## Collaboration Redefined
*[SLIDE: Team Collaboration]*

**Collaboration Redefined**

For our organization users, I'm introducing powerful team features. Admins can now invite team members who can create, edit, and share themes together. When your theme is ready, publish it directly to your team's Power BI service. Seamless collaboration from start to finish.

*[SLIDE: Public Themes]*

And for our community—you can now share your creations with the world. Set any theme to public, and other Power UI users can explore it, customize it, make it their own. I can't wait to see what you'll create together.

---

## 1,500+ Dynamic Icons
*[SLIDE: Icon Library]*

**1,500+ Dynamic Icons**

But I didn't stop at themes. I've completely revolutionized how you work with icons in Power BI.

*[DEMO: Icon Browser]*

Over 1,500 clean, consistent icons—all browsable right from powerui.com. Find the perfect icon, customize its color, and copy a dynamic URL. No hosting required. No image management. Just paste and go.

*[DEMO: Dynamic Colors]*

And here's the magic—these URLs are dynamic. Change the color parameter, and your icon updates instantly. You can even use DAX formulas to change icon colors based on your data. Red for negative KPIs, green for positive—it's all possible.

---

## Available Today
*[SLIDE: Summary]*

**Available Today**

## Closing
*[CLOSING]*

I believe great design shouldn't be complicated. With Power UI Theme Studio, it isn't.

Thank you.

*[Applause]*
