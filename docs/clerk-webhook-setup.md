## What Clerk Handles Automatically

- Organization creation UI
- Member invitations and limits (respects your seat count)
- Role management (admin/member)
- Organization switching
- Member removal

## What Our Webhook Handles

- Syncs organizations to our database for license tracking
- Grants/revokes PRO features based on organization membership
- Links purchases to organizations

Note: Clerk automatically enforces seat limits based on the organization's subscription plan, so we don't need to track member counts manually.
