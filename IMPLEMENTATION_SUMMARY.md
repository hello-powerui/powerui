# Token Preservation Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The PowerUI theme system now properly preserves token references throughout the save/load cycle while still providing hex-resolved values for preview and export.

### Key Changes

1. **No Code Changes Required** - The system was already correctly designed to preserve tokens:
   - `ModernColorPicker` saves tokens in the correct format (`@bg-primary`)
   - `theme-builder-store` saves visual styles as-is without resolution
   - `theme-advanced-store` preserves values without modification

2. **Token Resolution Points**:
   - **Preview**: `generateTheme()` resolves tokens for Power BI preview
   - **Export**: `generateTheme()` resolves tokens for final theme export
   - **Save**: Original tokens are preserved in database

3. **How It Works**:
   ```typescript
   // User selects a token in UI
   { solid: { color: "@bg-primary" } }
   
   // Saved to database as-is
   visualStyles: {
     card: {
       "*": {
         background: { solid: { color: "@bg-primary" } }
       }
     }
   }
   
   // Preview/Export resolves based on current foundation
   // Light mode: @bg-primary → #ffffff
   // Dark mode: @bg-primary → #0d0d0d
   ```

### Benefits

1. **Dynamic Relationships**: When palettes or mode change, all token-based colors update automatically
2. **Editability**: Loaded themes show original token assignments
3. **Mixed Values**: Supports both tokens and custom hex values in same theme
4. **No Redundancy**: Single source of truth - no duplicate storage

### Testing

1. Create a theme with token-based colors
2. Save the theme
3. Change palette or mode - preview updates automatically
4. Reload the theme - tokens are preserved
5. Export the theme - tokens are resolved to hex values

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements without requiring significant code changes, leveraging the existing well-designed architecture.
