## Main Interface
- **Header**: Shows API connection status and statistics (18,512 properties, 52 visuals)
- **Left Panel**: Search and filter controls
- **Right Panel**: Results and property details

## Features to Try

### 1. Natural Language Search Box
Located at the top left. Try typing:
- "card background" 
- "chart text color"
- "make fonts bigger"

The AI understands your intent and finds relevant properties.

### 2. Property Results
Each property card shows:
- **Title**: Human-readable name
- **Path**: Exact location in schema (e.g., `visualStyles.card.*.background`)
- **Category**: Color-coded tag (purple for colors, blue for typography, etc.)
- **Type**: Data type (string, number, boolean)
- **Visuals**: Which visuals use this property

### 3. Property Details
Click any property to see:
- Example values (e.g., "#0078D4", "Segoe UI")
- Related properties that work well together
- Live theme JSON preview

### 4. Visual Structure Explorer
Bottom left dropdown - select a visual like "Card" to see:
- How many properties it has
- Properties organized by category
- Complexity rating

## What Makes This Special

1. **Instant Results**: No 2-second wait to load schema
2. **Smart Search**: Understands "blue card headers" â†’ finds the right properties
3. **Organized**: Properties are pre-categorized, not just a flat list
4. **Helpful**: Shows examples and related properties
5. **Live Preview**: See the theme JSON as you explore

This is what modern schema navigation looks like - fast, intelligent, and user-friendly!
