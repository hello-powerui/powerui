## Documentation Writing Guidelines

### Tone & Voice:
- Professional yet conversational - like an experienced colleague explaining concepts
- Educational and explanatory, not just listing facts
- Focus on the "why" behind recommendations, not just the "what"
- Avoid overly technical jargon while maintaining expertise

### Structure:
- Use proper headings with semantic HTML (h3 for subsections)
- Write in substantive paragraphs (3-5 sentences each) rather than bullet points
- Each paragraph should build on the previous one, creating a logical flow
- Start with context/background, then explain details, then provide reasoning

### Content Approach:
- Begin with the technical facts, then expand to practical implications
- Include real-world scenarios and consequences ("if you find yourself...")
- Explain the human/UX impact, not just technical limitations
- End with broader principles or best practices that tie back to professional standards

### Formatting:
- Use text-gray-700 for body text (not text-gray-600 which is too light)
- Add leading-relaxed for better readability
- Use mb-4 between paragraphs for proper spacing
- Keep paragraphs visually distinct, not in boxes or cards
