# Custom Formatting in Your Blog Posts

This post demonstrates all the formatting options available in your new blog system.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for subtle emphasis, and ***both together*** for maximum impact.

## Headers and Structure

### Third-level headers work great for subsections

Headers help organize your content and make it scannable.

## Links and Navigation

Here's an [external link](https://www.powerbi.com) that opens in a new tab, and here's an [internal link](/pricing) to another page.

## Images

Images from external sources work seamlessly:

## Code Examples

Inline code like `theme.dataColors` is great for mentioning specific properties.

For larger code blocks, you get syntax highlighting:

```json
{
  "name": "Professional Theme",
  "dataColors": [
    "#1E40AF",
    "#3B82F6",
    "#60A5FA",
    "#93BBFD",
    "#C7DBFE"
  ],
  "background": "#FFFFFF",
  "foreground": "#1F2937"
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- First point
- Second point
  - Nested point
  - Another nested point
- Third point

### Ordered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Blockquotes

## Tips for Writing Great Blog Posts

1. **Start with a clear structure** - Outline your main points before writing
2. **Use images to break up text** - Visual examples make concepts clearer
3. **Include code examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Keep paragraphs short** - Easier to read on screens
5. **End with a call to action** - What should readers do next?

## Summary

This blog system supports all the formatting you need to create engaging, informative posts about Power BI and data visualization. The simple file-based approach means you can write in your favorite text editor and see changes immediately.
