Typography might be the most overlooked aspect of Power BI report design. Yet it plays a crucial role in shaping how users perceive and interact with your data. The right font choices and consistent use of font weights improve readability, create visual hierarchy, and enhance the overall user experience.

In this guide, we'll explore how to leverage typography effectively in Power BI to create dashboards that communicate clearly and look professional.

## Why Typography Matters More Than You Think

Consider two dashboards with identical data and visualizations. One uses random fonts, inconsistent sizes, and poor spacing. The other applies thoughtful typography with clear hierarchy. Which would you trust more? Which would be easier to use?

Typography affects:
- **Readability**: How easily users can consume information
- **Hierarchy**: What users see first, second, and third
- **Professionalism**: The perceived quality and trustworthiness of your data
- **User efficiency**: How quickly users find what they need

## Understanding Font Application in Power BI

### Two Ways to Apply Fonts

Power BI handles fonts in two distinct ways:

1. **Theme file specification**: Define custom fonts and weights for specific components
2. **Default font selection**: Choose from Power BI's built-in font list

When you specify a custom font in a theme file, it only applies to components defined in that theme. It won't appear in Power BI's font dropdown for other elements—an important limitation to understand.

### The Default Font Mix

When you create a new Power BI report, the default theme combines two fonts:

- **Segoe UI**: Used for most components (text boxes, labels, titles)
- **DIN**: Applied to KPI cards, axis labels, slicer headers

This mix can create visual inconsistency. For a more cohesive design, choose one font family and use it throughout your report.

## Choosing the Right Fonts for Your Dashboards

### Font Selection Criteria

Not all fonts work well in dashboards. Consider these factors:

**1. Font weight variety**
Choose fonts with at least 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). This variety allows you to create hierarchy without changing font families.

**2. Screen readability**
Sans-serif fonts generally perform better on screens than serif fonts. They remain clear at small sizes and low resolutions.

**3. Universal availability**
Ensure your chosen fonts display correctly for all users. Web-safe fonts guarantee consistency across operating systems.

**4. Professional appearance**
Select fonts that match your organization's tone—modern and clean for tech companies, traditional for financial institutions.

### Recommended Font Choices

**Segoe UI (Top Choice)**

![Segoe UI font family showcase](/blog-images/segoe-ui-showcase.jpg)

Why Segoe UI excels:
- Six available weights for maximum flexibility
- Designed specifically for screen readability
- Native to Windows and Power BI
- Clean, modern appearance
- Excellent character spacing

**Arial (Web-Safe Alternative)**

When absolute compatibility matters:
- Available on every operating system
- Three weights (Regular, Bold, Black)
- Familiar and professional
- Never fails to render

**Custom Fonts (Use Cautiously)**

Only consider custom fonts when:
- Your IT team controls all user devices
- The font is critical to brand identity
- You can ensure consistent installation
- You have fallback options planned

## Understanding Font Sizing in Power BI

### Points vs. Pixels

Power BI uses points (pt) like Microsoft Office, while web designers typically think in pixels (px). Understanding the conversion helps maintain consistency:

- **12pt = 16px**: Standard body text
- **9pt = 12px**: Minimum readable size
- **18pt = 24px**: Appropriate for titles
- **14pt = 18.67px**: Subheadings

### Accessibility Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend:
- **Minimum 16px (12pt)** for body text
- **Never go below 12px (9pt)** even for secondary information
- **Consider your audience**: Older users may need larger sizes

## Creating Hierarchy Through Typography

### The Power of Size and Weight

Visual hierarchy guides users through your dashboard in order of importance. Typography is your primary tool for establishing this hierarchy.

**Use larger, bolder fonts for:**
- Dashboard titles
- Section headers
- Critical KPIs that need immediate attention

**Use smaller, lighter fonts for:**
- Axis labels and legends
- Supporting details
- Footnotes and data sources

### Implementing a Type Scale

A type scale provides predefined sizes that work harmoniously together. Here's a practical scale for Power BI:

```
H1 - Dashboard Title: 24px (18pt) - Semibold
H2 - Section Headers: 20px (15pt) - Medium
H3 - Subsection Headers: 16px (12pt) - Medium
Body - Standard Text: 14px (11pt) - Regular
Small - Secondary Info: 12px (9pt) - Regular
```

### Consistency is Key

Once you establish your type scale:
1. Document it clearly
2. Apply it consistently across all dashboards
3. Save it in a custom theme file
4. Share with your team

## Practical Typography Tips for Power BI

### 1. Start with a Clean Slate

Before applying typography:
- Remove default DIN font usage
- Standardize to one font family
- Reset all sizes to your scale

### 2. Use Weight for Emphasis

Instead of using different fonts for emphasis:
- Keep the same font family
- Vary the weight (Light to Bold)
- This maintains cohesion while creating contrast

### 3. Mind the Line Length

Long lines of text are hard to read:
- Keep text blocks under 60 characters wide
- Use multiple columns for lengthy content
- Break up text with visuals

### 4. Leverage White Space

Typography needs room to breathe:
- Add padding around text elements
- Increase line spacing for better readability
- Don't crowd text against visual edges

### 5. Test at Different Sizes

Your dashboard might be viewed on various screens:
- Test readability at 75% zoom
- Ensure titles remain prominent when scaled
- Verify smallest text stays legible

## Common Typography Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Many Fonts

**Problem**: Using different fonts for every element
**Solution**: Stick to one font family with weight variations

### 2. Inconsistent Sizing

**Problem**: Randomly choosing sizes for each element
**Solution**: Establish and follow a type scale

### 3. Poor Contrast

**Problem**: Light gray text on white backgrounds
**Solution**: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios

### 4. Overuse of Bold

**Problem**: Making everything bold for emphasis
**Solution**: Use bold sparingly for true emphasis

### 5. Ignoring Alignment

**Problem**: Center-aligning everything
**Solution**: Left-align for readability, center only titles

## Advanced Typography Techniques

### Creating a Typography System

For organizations with multiple dashboard creators:

1. **Define standards**: Document font choices, sizes, and weights
2. **Create templates**: Build reusable layouts with proper typography
3. **Use theme files**: Lock in typography choices technically
4. **Provide examples**: Show good and bad implementations
5. **Regular reviews**: Ensure standards are followed

### Dynamic Typography with DAX

While less common, you can create dynamic text formatting:
- Change text color based on values
- Adjust sizing for emphasis
- Create conditional formatting rules

```DAX
Text Color = 
IF([Sales Growth] > 0.1, "#2E7D32", 
IF([Sales Growth] < -0.1, "#C62828", "#424242"))
```

## Typography Checklist for Every Dashboard

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Single font family used throughout
- [ ] Consistent type scale applied
- [ ] Minimum 12px (9pt) font size
- [ ] Clear hierarchy established
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for all text
